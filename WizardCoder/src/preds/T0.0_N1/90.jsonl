The `find_zero` function takes a list of coefficients `xs` and returns the value of `x` such that the polynomial `poly(x)` is equal to zero. The function first checks if the length of `xs` is even, and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. It then normalizes the coefficients by dividing them by the maximum absolute value, so that the largest non-zero coefficient is 1. It then rearranges the coefficients so that the first non-zero coefficient is at the beginning of the list. It then uses the coefficients to find the value of `x` using the method of Horner's rule.
