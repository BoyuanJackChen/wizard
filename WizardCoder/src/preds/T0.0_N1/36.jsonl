The function first checks if `n` is equal to 1 or 2, in which case it returns the appropriate list. Otherwise, it initializes the list with the first two numbers of the sequence, `1` and `3`, and then iterates over the remaining numbers of the sequence using a `for` loop. For each number, it checks if it is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If it is even, it appends `1 + i // 2` to the list, where `i` is the current index. If it is odd, it appends the sum of the previous three numbers of the sequence to the list using the formula `tri_list[i-1] + tri_list[i-2] + tri_list[i+1]`.
