The function uses the built-in `eval` function to evaluate the `expression` string and returns the result.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how to use the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\r\narray = [2, 3, 4, 5]\r\nresult = do_algebra(operator, array)\r\nprint(result)  # Output: 9\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `operator` list is `['+', '*', '-']`, and the `array` list is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The function builds the expression `2 + 3 * 4 - 5` and evaluates it to get the result `9`.
