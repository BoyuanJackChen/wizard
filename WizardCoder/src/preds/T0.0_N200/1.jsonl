It uses a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses and a current group variable to keep track of the current group of parentheses being processed. It iterates through the input string and adds opening parentheses to the stack and the current group. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it pops the top element from the stack and adds it to the current group. If the stack is empty, it means that the current group is complete and is added to the list of groups. Finally, it returns the list of groups.
