It then iterates over each row in the list using the `enumerate` function. For each row, it checks if the integer `x` is present in the row using the `in` operator.

It then appends a tuple containing the row index and the column index of `x` to the `result` list.\r\n\r\nAfter iterating over all the rows, the function sorts the `result` list first by rows in ascending order using the `sort` method. Then, it sorts the rows of the list by columns in descending order using the `sort` method and a lambda function as the key. The lambda function returns the second element of the tuple, which is the column index of the integer `x`. Finally, the function returns the sorted `result` list.\r\n\r\nThe function works as expected for the given examples. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
