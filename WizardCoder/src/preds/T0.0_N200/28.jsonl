The function first initializes an empty list `collatz_sequence` to store the collatz sequence for the given number `n`. It then enters a loop that continues until `n` becomes 1. In each iteration of the loop, it checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it divides it by 2. If `n` is odd, it multiplies it by 3 and adds 1. The loop continues until `n` becomes 1. At this point, the function appends all the odd numbers in the `collatz_sequence` to the `odd_numbers` list. Finally, the function returns the sorted `odd_numbers` list.
