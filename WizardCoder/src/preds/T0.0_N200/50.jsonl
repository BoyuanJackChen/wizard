It first splits the sentence into words using the `split` method, and then iterates through each word in the sentence. For each word, it checks if its length is prime using the `is_prime` helper function. If the length is prime, it adds the word to a list of prime words. Finally, it joins the prime words into a single string using the `join` method and returns it.\r\n\r\nThe `is_prime` function takes a number as input and returns `True` if it is prime, and `False` otherwise. It first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, in which case it is not prime. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive), checking if any of them divide the number evenly. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, indicating that the number is not prime. If it reaches the end of the loop without finding a divisor, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is prime. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
