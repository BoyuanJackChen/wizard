The function first checks if the input array is empty, and if so, returns True. Then, it iterates through the array and checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns False, indicating that it is not possible to obtain a sorted array by performing right shift operations. If the function completes the iteration without finding any elements out of order, it returns True, indicating that it is possible to obtain a sorted array by performing right shift operations.
