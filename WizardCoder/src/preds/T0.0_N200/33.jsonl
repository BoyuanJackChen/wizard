If a number is positive, we set its sign to 1, if it's negative, we set its sign to -1, and if it's 0, we set its sign to 0.\r\n3. We calculate the product of all the signs in the `signs` list using a for loop.\r\n4. We calculate the sum of magnitudes of integers in the input array using a list comprehension and the `abs` function.\r\n5. We return the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of all signs.\r\n\r\nLet's test the function with the given examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(prod_signs([1, 2, 2, -4])) # Output: -9\r\nprint(prod_signs([0, 1])) # Output: 0\r\nprint(prod_signs([])) # Output: None\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is as expected.
