The function first checks if the input array is empty, and if so, returns an empty list. Then, it iterates through the array to find the smallest even value and its index. If there are no even values, it returns an empty list. Finally, it returns the plucked node as a list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
