The function takes a string `paren_string` as input and returns a list of integers.\r\n2. The input string is split by spaces to get individual groups.\r\n3. For each group, the function initializes a counter for the deepest level of nesting (`max_level`) and a counter for the current level of nesting (`level`).\r\n4. The function iterates through each character in the group and updates the `level` counter accordingly.\r\n5. If the `level` counter is greater than the `max_level` counter, the `max_level` counter is updated.\r\n6. After iterating through all characters in the group, the `max_level` counter is added to the output list.\r\n7. The output list is returned.
