We define a function called `compare` that takes two arguments, `game` and `guess`.\r\n2. We create an empty list called `result` to store the comparison results.\r\n3. We loop through each index of the `game` and `guess` arrays using the `range` function.\r\n4. We check if the value at the current index of `game` is equal to the value at the current index of `guess`.\r\n5. If they are equal, we append 0 to the `result` list.\r\n6. If they are not equal, we append the absolute difference between the values at the current index of `game` and `guess` to the `result` list.\r\n7. Once we have compared all the values in the `game` and `guess` arrays, we return the `result` list.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function with the example inputs provided in the problem statement:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2])) # [0,0,0,0,3,3]\r\nprint(compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2])) # [4,4,1,0,0,6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]\r\n[4, 4, 1, 0, 0, 6]\r\n``` ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
