First, we check if the given number is less than 100. If it is not, we return False because the problem statement says that the given number should be less than 100.\r\n2. We initialize a variable to store the count of prime factors of the given number. We will use this variable to check if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers.\r\n3. We check if the given number is divisible by 2. If it is, we increment the count of prime factors and divide the number by 2 to check for the next factor.\r\n4. We check if the given number is divisible by any odd prime number. We start with 3 and check if the given number is divisible by any odd prime number less than or equal to the square root of the given number. If it is, we increment the count of prime factors and divide the number by the prime number to check for the next factor.\r\n5. We check if the given number is divisible by any prime number greater than 3. If it is, we increment the count of prime factors.\r\n6. We return True if the count of prime factors is 3, indicating that the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers. Otherwise, we return False.\r\n\r\nNote that we have used the `range` function to generate odd prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the given number. This is because we only need to check odd prime numbers to find the prime factors of the given number. We also use the `int` function to convert the square root to an integer, so that we only check odd prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the given number.
