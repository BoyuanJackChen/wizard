The function iterates through the range `[1, n]` and checks if each number is a palindrome. If a number is a palindrome, it is checked if it is even or odd and the respective count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the tuple with the counts of even and odd palindromes. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
