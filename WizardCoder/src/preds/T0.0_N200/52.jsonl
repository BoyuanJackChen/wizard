The `order_by_points` function takes a list of integers as input.\r\n2. It defines a helper function `sum_of_digits` which takes a number as input and returns the sum of its digits.\r\n3. The `sorted` function is used to sort the input list based on the sum of digits and index.\r\n4. The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is set to a lambda function which takes an element of the list and returns a tuple of two values: the sum of digits of the element and its index in the original list.\r\n5. The sorted list is returned as the output of the function.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12])) # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\r\nprint(order_by_points([])) # Output: []\r\nprint(order_by_points([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\r\nprint(order_by_points([123, 456, 789])) # Output: [123, 456, 789]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of the above test cases is as expected.
