We define a function called `solution` that takes a list of integers as input.\r\n2. We initialize a variable called `total` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions.\r\n3. We loop through the list using a for loop and the `range` function with a step of 2. This ensures that we only consider elements that are in even positions.\r\n4. For each element at the current position, we check if it is odd by using the modulo operator `%`. If the element is odd, we add it to the `total` variable.\r\n5. After the loop is finished, we return the `total` variable, which contains the sum of all the odd elements that are in even positions.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function with the given examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(solution([5, 8, 7, 1])) # Output: 12\r\nprint(solution([3, 3, 3, 3, 3])) # Output: 9\r\nprint(solution([30, 13, 24, 321])) # Output: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is as expected.
