We define a function called `count_upper` that takes a string `s` as input.\r\n2. We initialize a variable `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.\r\n3. We loop through the string `s` using a `for` loop and the `range` function with a step of 2. This ensures that we only consider even indices.\r\n4. For each even index `i`, we check if the character at that index is uppercase and a vowel. If it is, we increment the `count` variable by 1.\r\n5. Finally, we return the `count` variable, which contains the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.\r\n\r\nLet's test the function with some examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint(count_upper('aBCdEf')) # Output: 1\r\nprint(count_upper('abcdefg')) # Output: 0\r\nprint(count_upper('dBBE')) # Output: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is as expected.
