The extra characters are there to help with the format.\r\n\r\n    Examples:\r\n    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns \"db1111db\"\r\n    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns \"db100000db\"\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]\r\n    binary = '0'*(8-len(binary)) + binary\r\n    binary = 'db' + binary + 'db'\r\n    return binary\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. The `bin()` function is used to convert the decimal number to binary format. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string.\r\n2. The binary string is padded with '0' to ensure that it has 8 characters.\r\n3. The 'db' characters are added to the beginning and end of the binary string to indicate the start and end of the binary number.\r\n4.
