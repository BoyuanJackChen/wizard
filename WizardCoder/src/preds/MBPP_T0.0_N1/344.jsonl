{"task_id": 355, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the number of rectangles in a circle of radius r:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport math\r\n\r\ndef count_Rectangles(r):\r\n    if r == 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    else:\r\n        return int(math.pi * r**2 / 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe formula to find the number of rectangles in a circle of radius r is pi * r^2 / 2, where pi is the mathematical constant pi and r is the radius of the circle. We can use the math module in Python to get the value of pi. We can then use the int() function to round down the result to the nearest integer.\r\n\r\nWe can also add a check to see if the radius is zero, in which case there are no rectangles.
