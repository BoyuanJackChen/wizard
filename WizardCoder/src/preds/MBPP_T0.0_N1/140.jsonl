The function first checks if either of the numbers is equal to 1, in which case they cannot be co-prime. Then it iterates through all the numbers from 2 to the smaller of the two numbers and checks if they divide both `a` and `b` without a remainder. If any such number is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that the numbers are not co-prime. If no such number is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that the numbers are co-prime. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
