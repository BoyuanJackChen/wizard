It then enters a loop that increments the square until it finds the next perfect square greater than the given number. Finally, it returns the next perfect square.\r\n\r\nHere are some test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert next_Perfect_Square(35) == 36\r\nassert next_Perfect_Square(6) == 9\r\nassert next_Perfect_Square(9) == 16\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of the test examples pass.
