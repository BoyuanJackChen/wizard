{"task_id": 11, "completion": "Here's the Python function to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef remove_Occ(string, char):\r\n    if char in string:\r\n        first_index = string.find(char)\r\n        last_index = string.rfind(char)\r\n        if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1:\r\n            return string\r\n        elif first_index == last_index:\r\n            return string[:first_index] + string[first_index+1:]\r\n        else:\r\n            return string[:first_index] + string[first_index+1:last_index] + string[last_index+1:]\r\n    else:\r\n        return string\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments: the string to be modified and the character to be removed. It first checks if the character is present in the string. If it is, it finds the index of the first and last occurrence of the character using the `find()` and `rfind()` methods. If either of these indices is -1, it means that the character is not present in the string, so the function simply returns the original string. If the character is present only once, the function returns the original string with the first occurrence of the character removed. If the character is present multiple times, the function returns the original string with the first and last occurrences of the character removed.
