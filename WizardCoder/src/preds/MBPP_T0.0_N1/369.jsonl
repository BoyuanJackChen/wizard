{"task_id": 380, "completion": "Here's the Python code for the function `multi_list`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef multi_list(rows, cols):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for i in range(rows):\r\n        row = []\r\n        for j in range(cols):\r\n            row.append(i * cols + j)\r\n        result.append(row)\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments, `rows` and `cols`, which represent the number of rows and columns in the two-dimensional array. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the rows of the array. Then, it loops through each row and column, appending the value `i * cols + j` to the current row. This value represents the index of the element in the array, where the row number is `i` and the column number is `j`.
