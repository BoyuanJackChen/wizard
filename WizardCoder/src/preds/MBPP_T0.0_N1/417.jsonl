The algorithm works by sorting subarrays of the input array, each with a gap size of `gap`. The gap size is initially set to half the length of the array, and is then decreased by a factor of 2 until it reaches 1. At each step, the function iterates over the subarrays with the current gap size, and compares adjacent elements to determine if they are in the correct order. If not, the elements are swapped until the subarray is sorted. The sorted subarray is then merged with the previous subarrays to form a larger sorted array. The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
