It first checks if the array has only one element, in which case it returns that element. If the array has more than one element, it checks if the first element is less than the last element. If it is, then the minimum element must be in the first half of the array, so it returns the first element. If the first element is greater than the last element, then the minimum element must be in the second half of the array, so it recursively calls itself with the first and last indices shifted by one index.
