A string is said to be undulating if it has the same character at the beginning and end of the string, and the same character at each adjacent pair of characters in the middle. For example, the string \"1212121\" is undulating because it has the same character '1' at the beginning, end, and at each adjacent pair of characters in the middle. The string \"1991\" is not undulating because it has different characters at the beginning and end of the string, and different characters at each adjacent pair of characters in the middle. The string \"121\" is undulating because it has the same character '1' at the beginning and end of the string, and the same character '1' at each adjacent pair of characters in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe function first converts the input `num` to a string if it is not already a string. It then checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, then the string cannot be undulating and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function iterates over the string from index 1 to n-2 (where n is the length of the string). At each index i, the function checks if the character at index i is different from the character at index i-1 and different from the character at index i+1. If any of these conditions is true, then the string is not undulating and the function returns `False`. If all the conditions are false, then the string is undulating and the function returns `True`.
