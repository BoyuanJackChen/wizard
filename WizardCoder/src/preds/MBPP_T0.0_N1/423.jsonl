If it does, it returns 'Found a match!', otherwise it returns 'Not matched!'. The function works by iterating through the string and checking each character. If an 'a' is found, it checks if the next character is a 'b'. If it is, it continues to the next character. If it's not, it returns 'Not matched!'. If a 'b' is found, it checks if the next character is an 'a'. If it is, it continues to the next character. If it's not, it returns 'Not matched!'. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns 'Not matched!'. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
