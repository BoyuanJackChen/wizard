It does this by iterating over each character in the string and checking if it is a digit or a letter using the `isdigit` and `isalpha` methods. If it is a digit, the `num_digits` counter is incremented, and if it is a letter, the `num_letters` counter is incremented. Finally, the function returns the tuple `(num_digits, num_letters)`.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function using the test examples provided:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert dig_let(\"python\")==(6,0)\r\nassert dig_let(\"program\")==(7,0)\r\nassert dig_let(\"python3.0\")==(6,2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case should return `(6,0)` because there are 6 characters in the string \"python\" and none of them are letters. The second test case should return `(7,0)` because there are 7 characters in the string \"program\" and none of them are letters. The third test case should return `(6,2)` because there are 6 characters in the string \"python3.0\" and there are 2 letters \"3\" and \"0\".
