{"task_id": 217, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the first repeated character in a given string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef first_Repeated_Char(string):\r\n    char_count = {}\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        if char in char_count:\r\n            char_count[char] += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            char_count[char] = 1\r\n    for char in string:\r\n        if char_count[char] > 1:\r\n            return char\r\n    return '\\0'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function first creates a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the string. It then iterates through the string, updating the count of each character in the dictionary. If a character is already in the dictionary, its count is incremented. If a character is not in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.\r\n\r\nAfter the dictionary is updated, the function iterates through the string again. If a character's count in the dictionary is greater than 1, it is the first repeated character and the function returns that character. If no character is repeated, the function returns '\\0'.
