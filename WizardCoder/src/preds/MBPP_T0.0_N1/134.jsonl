{"task_id": 145, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\r\n    max_diff = 0\r\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\r\n            diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[j])\r\n            if diff > max_diff:\r\n                max_diff = diff\r\n    return max_diff\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes an array as input and initializes a variable `max_diff` to 0. It then loops through the array using two nested loops, comparing each pair of elements. The absolute difference between each pair is calculated and stored in the variable `diff`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `diff`.
