The formula for the nth decagonal number is `(n * (n * n - 1)) // 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that the decagonal number can be expressed as the sum of the first n cubes, which is `(n * n * n)`. We subtract 1 from `n * n` to get the sum of the first n-1 cubes, and then divide by 2 to get the average. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
