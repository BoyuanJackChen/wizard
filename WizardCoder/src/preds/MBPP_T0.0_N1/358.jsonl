It returns the lateral surface area of the cuboid, which is calculated using the formula `2 * (length * width + width * height + height * length)`. The formula is derived from the fact that the lateral surface area of a cuboid is the sum of the areas of three rectangles, each of which has one side parallel to one of the three faces of the cuboid.
