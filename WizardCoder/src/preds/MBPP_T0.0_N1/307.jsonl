{"task_id": 318, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the maximum volume of a cuboid with given sum of sides:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef max_volume(sum_of_sides):\r\n    max_volume = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, sum_of_sides):\r\n        for j in range(i, sum_of_sides - i):\r\n            k = sum_of_sides - i - j\r\n            if i <= k and k <= j:\r\n                volume = i * j * k\r\n                if volume > max_volume:\r\n                    max_volume = volume\r\n    return max_volume\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes a single argument `sum_of_sides`, which is the sum of the three sides of the cuboid. It initializes a variable `max_volume` to 0, which will be used to store the maximum volume found so far.\r\n\r\nThe function then uses two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of three sides that add up to `sum_of_sides`. For each combination, it checks if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., the sum of any two sides is greater than or equal to the third side). If the sides satisfy the triangle inequality, it calculates the volume of the cuboid using the formula `volume = i * j * k`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are the lengths of the three sides. It then checks if the calculated volume is greater than the current maximum volume, and if so, updates `max_volume` to the new value.\r\n\r\nFinally, the function returns the maximum volume found.
