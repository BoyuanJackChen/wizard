It works by initializing a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest repeating subsequence ending at index `i` and having the same character as the character at index `j`. The function then iterates through the input string, updating the `dp` array and keeping track of the longest subsequence found so far. Finally, it returns the length of the longest subsequence.
