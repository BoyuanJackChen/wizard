{"task_id": 466, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_peak(arr, n):\r\n    if n < 1:\r\n        return None\r\n    \r\n    left = 0\r\n    right = n - 1\r\n    \r\n    while left < right:\r\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\r\n        \r\n        if arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]:\r\n            left = mid + 1\r\n        else:\r\n            right = mid\r\n            \r\n    return left\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function `find_peak` takes two arguments: an array `arr` and its length `n`. It returns the index of the peak element in the array.\r\n\r\nThe function first checks if the length of the array is less than 1. If it is, then there is no peak element and the function returns `None`.\r\n\r\nThe function then initializes two pointers `left` and `right` to the first and last indices of the array, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe function then enters a loop that continues until `left` is greater than or equal to `right`. In each iteration of the loop, the function computes the middle index `mid` of the current subarray and checks if the element at `mid` is less than or greater than the element at `mid + 1`.\r\n\r\nIf the element at `mid` is less than the element at `mid + 1`, then the function updates `left` to `mid + 1` because the peak element must be to the right of `mid`. Otherwise, the function updates `right` to `mid` because the peak element must be to the left of `mid`.\r\n\r\nAfter the loop terminates, the function returns the index of the peak element, which is the value of `left`.
