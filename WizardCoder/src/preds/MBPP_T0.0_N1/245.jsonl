{"task_id": 256, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Primes_nums(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(2, n):\r\n        if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, i)):\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. It uses a `for` loop to iterate over all numbers from 2 to `n-1`. For each number `i`, it checks if it is prime by using the `all()` function and a generator expression. The generator expression generates all numbers from 2 to `i-1` and checks if `i` is divisible by any of them. If `i` is prime, the `count` variable is incremented by 1.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert count_Primes_nums(5) == 2\r\nassert count_Primes_nums(10) == 4\r\nassert count_Primes_nums(100) == 25\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll test examples pass.
