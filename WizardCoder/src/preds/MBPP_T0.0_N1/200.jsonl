{"task_id": 211, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count numbers whose oth and nth bits are set:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Num(n):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if bin(i)[2] == '1' and bin(i)[3] == '1':\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of numbers whose oth and nth bits are set. It uses a `for` loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n`. For each number, it converts it to binary using the `bin()` function and extracts the oth and nth bits using indexing. If both bits are set, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert count_Num(2) == 1\r\nassert count_Num(3) == 2\r\nassert count_Num(1) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test example checks if the function returns 1 for the input 2, which is the only number whose oth and nth bits are set (i.e., 2). The second test example checks if the function returns 2 for the input 3, which are the numbers 3 and 5 (i.e., 11 and 17). The third test example checks if the function returns 1 for the input 1, which is the only number whose oth and nth bits are set (i.e., 1).
