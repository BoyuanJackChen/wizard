The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the maximum number in the list and reversing the list from the beginning to the maximum number and moving it to the beginning. Then, it reverses the list from the beginning to the length of the list and moves the maximum number to the end. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\r\n\r\nThe function first initializes a variable `n` to the length of the list. It then enters a while loop that continues until `n` is 1. Inside the loop, it finds the maximum number in the list using a for loop and stores its index in `max_index`. If the maximum number is not at the beginning of the list, it reverses the list from the beginning to the maximum number and moves it to the beginning. It then reverses the list from the beginning to the length of the list and moves the maximum number to the end. The loop continues until the list is sorted.\r\n\r\nFinally, the function returns the sorted list. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
