{"task_id": 58, "completion": "Here's the Python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef opposite_Signs(a, b):\r\n    if a*b < 0:\r\n        return True\r\n    else:\r\n        return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns `True` if they have opposite signs, and `False` otherwise. The logic behind this function is that if the product of `a` and `b` is negative, then they have opposite signs. Otherwise, they don't have opposite signs.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True\r\nassert opposite_Signs(3,2) == False\r\nassert opposite_Signs(-10,-10) == False\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the test examples pass, so the function is working correctly.
