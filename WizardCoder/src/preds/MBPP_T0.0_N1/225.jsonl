{"task_id": 236, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the maximum number of equilateral triangles that can be formed within a given equilateral triangle:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef No_of_Triangle(side, height):\r\n    if side < 2 or height < 2:\r\n        return -1\r\n    else:\r\n        return (side - 2) * (height - 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments: `side` and `height`. `side` is the length of the side of the equilateral triangle, and `height` is the height of the triangle.\r\n\r\nThe function first checks if either of the arguments is less than 2. If either of them is less than 2, the function returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to form any equilateral triangles within the given triangle. Otherwise, the function calculates the maximum number of equilateral triangles that can be formed within the given triangle using the formula `(side - 2) * (height - 2)`. This formula is based on the fact that each equilateral triangle can be formed by dividing the given equilateral triangle into two smaller equilateral triangles, each with a side length of `side - 2` and a height of `height - 2`. The formula calculates the maximum number of such triangles that can be formed within the given triangle.\r\n\r\nHere are the test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert No_of_Triangle(4,2) == 7\r\nassert No_of_Triangle(4,3) == 3\r\nassert No_of_Triangle(1,3) == -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case checks if the function returns the correct number of equilateral triangles that can be formed within a 4-unit equilateral triangle with a height of 2. The function should return 7, since there are 7 equilateral triangles that can be formed within the given triangle.\r\n\r\nThe second test case checks if the function returns the correct number of equilateral triangles that can be formed within a 4-unit equilateral triangle with a height of 3. The function should return 3, since there are 3 equilateral triangles that can be formed within the given triangle.\r\n\r\nThe third test case checks if the function returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to form any equilateral triangles within a 1-unit equilateral triangle with a height of 3.
