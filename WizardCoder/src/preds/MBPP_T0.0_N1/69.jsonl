{"task_id": 80, "completion": "Here's the Python script to find the nth tetrahedral number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\r\n    return (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe tetrahedral numbers are the numbers that can be formed by arranging 4 dots in a triangular pattern. There are 4 ways to arrange the dots, and each arrangement corresponds to a unique tetrahedron. Therefore, the nth tetrahedral number is given by the formula:\r\n\r\nn * (n + 1) // 2\r\n\r\nwhere // is the integer division operator. This formula gives the number of tetrahedra that can be formed using n dots. To find the nth tetrahedral number, we need to square this formula, since each tetrahedron has 6 faces and therefore 6 triangular faces. Therefore, the nth tetrahedral number is given by:\r\n\r\n(n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2\r\n\r\nThis formula can be implemented in Python using the `//` operator for integer division.
