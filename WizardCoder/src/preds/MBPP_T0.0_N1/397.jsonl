{"task_id": 408, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef k_smallest_pairs(arr1, arr2, k):\r\n    arr1.sort()\r\n    arr2.sort()\r\n    pairs = []\r\n    i = 0\r\n    j = 0\r\n    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2) and len(pairs) < k:\r\n        if arr1[i] + arr2[j] < arr1[i+1] + arr2[j]:\r\n            pairs.append([arr1[i], arr2[j]])\r\n            i += 1\r\n        else:\r\n            pairs.append([arr1[i], arr2[j+1]])\r\n            j += 1\r\n    return pairs\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes in two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` and an integer `k` as input. It first sorts the arrays in ascending order. Then, it initializes an empty list `pairs` to store the pairs of elements. It also initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to keep track of the current position in `arr1` and `arr2`, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe function then enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr1`, `j` is less than the length of `arr2`, and the length of `pairs` is less than `k`. In each iteration of the loop, the function checks if the sum of the elements at the current positions of `arr1` and `arr2` is less than the sum of the elements at the next positions of `arr1` and `arr2`. If it is, the function adds the pair `[arr1[i], arr2[j]]` to `pairs` and increments `i`. Otherwise, the function adds the pair `[arr1[i], arr2[j+1]]` to `pairs` and increments `j`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the function returns the list `pairs` containing the `k` smallest pairs of elements from `arr1` and `arr2`.
