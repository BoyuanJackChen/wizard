{"task_id": 289, "completion": "Here's the Python function to calculate the number of odd days in a given year:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef odd_Days(year):\r\n    # Calculate the number of leap years in the given year\r\n    leap_years = year // 4 - year // 100 + year // 400\r\n    \r\n    # Calculate the number of days in the given year\r\n    days = 365 + leap_years\r\n    \r\n    # Calculate the number of odd days in the given year\r\n    odd_days = days // 2\r\n    \r\n    return odd_days\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function first calculates the number of leap years in the given year using the formula:\r\n\r\n```\r\nleap_years = year // 4 - year // 100 + year // 400\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis formula takes into account the fact that every 4 years is a leap year, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. For example, 2000 was a leap year, but 2100 and 2200 are not.\r\n\r\nNext, the function calculates the total number of days in the given year by adding the number of leap years to the standard number of days in a year (365).\r\n\r\nFinally, the function calculates the number of odd days in the given year by dividing the total number of days by 2 and rounding down to the nearest integer.\r\n\r\nThe function returns the number of odd days in the given year.
