{"task_id": 375, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef round_num(num, multiple):\r\n    return multiple * round(num/multiple)\r\n\r\n# Test cases\r\nassert round_num(4722,10)==4720\r\nassert round_num(1111,5)==1110\r\nassert round_num(219,2)==218\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `round_num` function takes two arguments: `num` and `multiple`. It returns the nearest multiple of `multiple` that is less than or equal to `num`. For example, `round_num(4722,10)` returns `4720` because `4720` is the nearest multiple of `10` that is less than or equal to `4722`. Similarly, `round_num(1111,5)` returns `1110` because `1110` is the nearest multiple of `5` that is less than or equal to `1111`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
