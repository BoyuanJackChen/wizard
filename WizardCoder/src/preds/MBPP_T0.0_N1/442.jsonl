{"task_id": 453, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the sum of even factors of a number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sumofFactors(n):\r\n    sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        if n % i == 0 and i % 2 == 0:\r\n            sum += i\r\n    return sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes a number `n` as input and initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then loops through all the numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is a factor of `n` and also an even number. If both conditions are true, the number is added to the `sum`. Finally, the function returns the `sum` of all the even factors of `n`.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function using the test examples provided:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert sumofFactors(18) == 26\r\nassert sumofFactors(30) == 48\r\nassert sumofFactors(6) == 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case should return `26` because the even factors of `18` are `2` and `9`, and their sum is `11`. The second test case should return `48` because the even factors of `30` are `2`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `10`, and `15`, and their sum is `48`. The third test case should return `8` because the only even factor of `6` is `2`, and its sum is `2`. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
