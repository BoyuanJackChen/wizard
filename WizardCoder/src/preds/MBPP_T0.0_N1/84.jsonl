{"task_id": 95, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the minimum length of sublist:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Find_Min_Length(lst):\r\n    min_length = float('inf')\r\n    for sublist in lst:\r\n        if len(sublist) < min_length:\r\n            min_length = len(sublist)\r\n    return min_length\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes a list of lists as input and initializes a variable `min_length` to infinity. It then iterates through each sublist in the input list and checks if its length is less than the current `min_length`. If it is, it updates `min_length` to the length of the current sublist. Finally, it returns `min_length`.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1],[1,2]]) == 1\r\nassert Find_Min_Length([[1,2],[1,2,3],[1,2,3,4]]) == 2\r\nassert Find_Min_Length([[3,3,3],[4,4,4,4]]) == 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the test examples pass.
