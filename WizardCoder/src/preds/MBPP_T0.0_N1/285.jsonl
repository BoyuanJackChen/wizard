{"task_id": 296, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count inversions in an array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr, n):\r\n    inv_count = 0\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\r\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\r\n                inv_count += 1\r\n    return inv_count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments: the array `arr` and its length `n`. It initializes a variable `inv_count` to 0, which will be used to count the number of inversions in the array. It then loops through the array using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each element of the array, while the inner loop iterates over all the elements that come after it in the array. For each pair of elements, the function checks if the first element is greater than the second element. If it is, then there is an inversion, and the `inv_count` variable is incremented. Finally, the function returns the `inv_count` variable, which represents the total number of inversions in the array.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert get_Inv_Count([1,20,6,4,5],5) == 5\r\nassert get_Inv_Count([1,2,1],3) == 1\r\nassert get_Inv_Count([1,2,5,6,1],5) == 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll three test cases pass, so the function seems to be working correctly.
