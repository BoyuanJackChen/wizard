It returns the perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of all three sides. \r\n\r\nThe test cases are assertions that check if the function returns the correct perimeter for different inputs. The first test case checks if the perimeter of a right triangle with sides of length 10, 20, and 30 is 60. The second test case checks if the perimeter of a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 is 12.
