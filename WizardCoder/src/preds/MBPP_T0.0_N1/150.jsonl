{"task_id": 161, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\r\n    return [x for x in list1 if x not in list2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `remove_elements` function takes two lists as input and returns a new list with all the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each element in `list1` and checks if it is not in `list2`. If the element is not in `list2`, it is added to the new list.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function using the provided test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert remove_elements([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],[2,4,6,8])==[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]\r\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],[1, 3, 5, 7])==[2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]\r\nassert remove_elements([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],[5,7])==[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the test cases pass, so we can conclude that the function is working correctly.
