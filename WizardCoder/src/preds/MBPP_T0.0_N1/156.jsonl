The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits required to represent an integer in binary notation. For example, `2.bit_length()` returns 2, since 2 is represented by the binary number 10 in two bits. Therefore, `2**(n-1).bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. Since `n-1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, we can use this to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.
