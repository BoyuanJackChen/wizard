{"task_id": 185, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef parabola_focus(a, b, c):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Given the coefficients of a quadratic equation in standard form,\r\n    find the focus of the parabola.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    # Calculate the discriminant\r\n    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\r\n    \r\n    # Calculate the focus\r\n    focus_x = -b / (2*a)\r\n    focus_y = discriminant / (4*a**2)\r\n    \r\n    return (focus_x, focus_y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes three arguments: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the coefficients of the quadratic equation in standard form: `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. The function first calculates the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is `b^2 - 4ac`. If the discriminant is positive, the parabola has two distinct real roots and therefore two foci. If the discriminant is zero, the parabola has one real root and one focus. If the discriminant is negative, the parabola has no real roots and therefore no foci.\r\n\r\nThe function then calculates the x-coordinate of the focus by setting `x = -b / (2a)`, where `a` is the coefficient of `x^2`. The y-coordinate of the focus is calculated by setting `y = discriminant / (4a^2)`, where `discriminant` is the calculated discriminant. The function returns a tuple containing the x- and y-coordinates of the focus.\r\n\r\nTo test the function, we can use the provided test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert parabola_focus(5,3,2)==(-0.3, 1.6)\r\nassert parabola_focus(9,8,4)==(-0.4444444444444444, 2.25)\r\nassert parabola_focus(2,4,6)==(-1.0, 4.125)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test example checks the focus of the parabola `5x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0`.
