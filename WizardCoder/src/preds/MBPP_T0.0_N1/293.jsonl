{"task_id": 304, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the element at a given index after number of rotations:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Element(arr, rotations, index, n):\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        arr = arr[-rotations[i][1]:] + arr[:-rotations[i][1]]\r\n    return arr[index]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's break down the function:\r\n\r\n- `arr` is the list of elements that has been rotated.\r\n- `rotations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the starting and ending index of the rotated portion of the list.\r\n- `index` is the index of the element we want to find.\r\n- `n` is the length of the original list.\r\n\r\nThe function first creates a new list `arr` that contains the rotated portion of the original list. This is done by slicing the original list from the end of the rotated portion to the beginning of the rotated portion, and then concatenating the original list from the end of the rotated portion to the beginning of the original list.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the original list is `[1,2,3,4,5]` and the rotations are `[0,2]`, then the rotated portion is `[3,4,5,1,2]`.\r\n\r\nThe function then returns the element at the given index in the rotated list.\r\n\r\nHere are the test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert find_Element([1,2,3,4,5],[[0,2],[0,3]],2,1) == 3\r\nassert find_Element([1,2,3,4],[[0,1],[0,2]],1,2) == 3\r\nassert find_Element([1,2,3,4,5,6],[[0,1],[0,2]],1,1) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case tests the case where the original list is `[1,2,3,4,5]` and the rotations are `[0,2]` and `[0,3]`.
