The hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. \r\n\r\nTo find the hamming distance, we first perform a bitwise XOR operation between `x` and `y`. This gives us a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits in `x` and `y` are different, and 0 otherwise. We then count the number of set bits in this binary number using a loop and bitwise AND operation.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function using the test examples provided:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert hamming_Distance(4,8) == 2\r\nassert hamming_Distance(2,4) == 2\r\nassert hamming_Distance(1,2) == 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the test cases pass.
