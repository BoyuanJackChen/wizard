Each row of an octagon has 8 numbers, and the first row has 1 number, the second row has 2 numbers, the third row has 3 numbers, and so on. The nth octagonal number is the sum of the first n numbers in the nth row of an octagon.\r\n\r\nFor example, the first 5 numbers in the first row of an octagon are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The first 5 numbers in the second row of an octagon are 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The first 5 numbers in the third row of an octagon are 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. And so on.\r\n\r\nThe nth octagonal number can be found by summing the first n numbers in the nth row of an octagon. This can be done using the formula:\r\n\r\n```\r\nn * (3 * n - 1) // 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis formula calculates the sum of the first n numbers in the nth row of an octagon. The `//` operator is used to perform integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer.\r\n\r\nThe `is_octagonal` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth octagonal number using the formula above.
