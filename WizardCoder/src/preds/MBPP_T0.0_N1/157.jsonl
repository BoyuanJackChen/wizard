{"task_id": 168, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the frequency of a number in a given array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef frequency(arr, num):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in arr:\r\n        if i == num:\r\n            count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function takes two arguments: the array `arr` and the number `num` to search for in the array. It initializes a counter `count` to 0 and then loops through each element in the array. If the element is equal to the number being searched for, the counter is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of occurrences of the number in the array.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert frequency([1,2,3],4) == 0\r\nassert frequency([1,2,2,3,3,3,4],3) == 3\r\nassert frequency([0,1,2,3,1,2],1) == 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll three test examples should return `True`.
