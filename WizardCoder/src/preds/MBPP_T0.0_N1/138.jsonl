It first checks if the array is empty, in which case it returns 0. It then initializes a dictionary `last_idx` to store the last index of each element in the array. It also initializes variables `max_len` and `curr_len` to store the length of the longest subsequence and the current subsequence length, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe function then iterates through the array from index 1 to n-1. For each element, it checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element is 1. If it is, it updates the last index of the current element and increments the current subsequence length. If the difference is not 1, it resets the current subsequence length to 1 and updates the last index of the current element.\r\n\r\nFinally, the function returns the maximum subsequence length found during the iteration.\r\n\r\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the function iterates through the array only once. The space complexity of the function is also O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the function uses a dictionary to store the last index of each element in the array. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
