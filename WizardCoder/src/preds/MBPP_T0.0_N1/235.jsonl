{"task_id": 246, "completion": "Here's the Python script for computing square roots using the babylonian method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef babylonian_squareroot(n):\r\n    x = n / 2\r\n    while True:\r\n        y = (x + n / x) / 2\r\n        if y == x:\r\n            return y\r\n        x = y\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes a number `n` as input and returns its square root using the babylonian method. The algorithm works by repeatedly computing the average of `n` and `n/x`, where `x` is the current estimate of the square root. The algorithm converges to the square root of `n` as `x` approaches the correct value.\r\n\r\nTo test the function, we can use the `assert` statement to check that it returns the expected values for some test cases. Here are the test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert babylonian_squareroot(10)==3.162277660168379\r\nassert babylonian_squareroot(2)==1.414213562373095\r\nassert babylonian_squareroot(9)==3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case checks that the function returns the correct square root of 10.
