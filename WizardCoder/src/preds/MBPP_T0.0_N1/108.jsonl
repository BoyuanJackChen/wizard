If it does, the function returns that element.\r\n\r\nNext, the function checks if the first and second elements are different. If they are, the function returns the first element. This is because if the first and second elements are the same, then the element that appears only once must be in the third position.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the function checks if the last and second-to-last elements are different. If they are, the function returns the last element. This is because if the last and second-to-last elements are the same, then the element that appears only once must be in the second-to-last position.\r\n\r\nFinally, the function iterates through the array from the third element to the second-to-last element. If the current element is different from both the previous and next elements, then the function returns that element. This is because if the current element is the same as the previous or next element, then it cannot be the element that appears only once.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert search([1,1,2,2,3]) == 3\r\nassert search([1,1,3,3,4,4,5,5,7,7,8]) == 8\r\nassert search([1,2,2,3,3,4,4]) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll test cases pass.
