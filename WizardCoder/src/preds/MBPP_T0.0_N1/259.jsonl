{"task_id": 270, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst, n):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    This function takes a list and a number n as input and returns the sum of even numbers at even positions.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    even_sum = 0\r\n    for i in range(0, n, 2):\r\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\r\n            even_sum += lst[i]\r\n    return even_sum\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. We define a function called `sum_even_and_even_index` that takes two arguments: `lst` (the list of numbers) and `n` (the number of even positions to consider).\r\n2. We initialize a variable called `even_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of even numbers at even positions.\r\n3. We use a `for` loop to iterate over the even positions in the list. We use the `range` function with a step of 2 to get only the even positions.\r\n4. For each even position, we check if the number at that position is even by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0.\r\n5. If the number at the even position is even, we add it to the `even_sum` variable.\r\n6. After iterating over all even positions, we return the `even_sum` variable.\r\n\r\nLet's test the function with the given test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8],6) == 30\r\nassert sum_even_and_even_index([3, 20, 17, 9, 2, 10, 18, 13, 6, 18],10) == 26\r\nassert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1],4) == 12\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function works as expected and passes all the test cases.
