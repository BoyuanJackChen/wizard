{"task_id": 28, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find binomial co-efficient:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef binomial_Coeff(n, k):\r\n    if k > n:\r\n        return 0\r\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\r\n        return 1\r\n    return binomial_Coeff(n-1, k-1) + binomial_Coeff(n-1, k)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments n and k, where n is the number of elements in the set and k is the number of elements to be selected.\r\n\r\nThe function first checks if k is greater than n, in which case it returns 0 as there cannot be more elements selected than there are in the set.\r\n\r\nIf k is either 0 or n, then there is only one way to select k elements, so the function returns 1.\r\n\r\nIf k is between 1 and n-1, then there are two ways to select k elements: either include the kth element or exclude it.
