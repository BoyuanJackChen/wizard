It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each tuple in the list. The function iterates over each tuple in the list and checks if it is already present in the dictionary. If it is not present, it adds the tuple to the dictionary with a frequency of 1. If it is already present, it increments the frequency of the tuple by 1.
