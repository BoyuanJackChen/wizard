{"task_id": 303, "completion": "Here's the Python function to check whether the count of inversion of two types are same or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef solve(arr, n):\r\n    count = [0] * n\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        count[arr[i]] += 1\r\n    \r\n    type1 = type2 = 0\r\n    for i in range(n):\r\n        if arr[i] == 0:\r\n            type1 += 1\r\n        elif arr[i] == 1:\r\n            type2 += 1\r\n    \r\n    return count[0] == type1 and count[1] == type2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments: `arr` is the input array and `n` is the number of types in the array. The function first counts the frequency of each type in the array using the `count` array. Then, it counts the number of elements of each type separately using the `type1` and `type2` variables. Finally, it checks whether the count of inversion of two types are same or not by comparing the counts of type 0 and type 1 with the `type1` and `type2` variables respectively. If they are same, the function returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`.\r\n\r\nHere are the test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert solve([1,0,2],3) == True\r\nassert solve([1,2,0],3) == False\r\nassert solve([1,2,1],3) == True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case checks whether the count of inversion of two types are same or not when the input array is `[1,0,2]` and the number of types is 3. The function returns `True` because the count of inversion of type 0 and type 1 are both 1.\r\n\r\nThe second test case checks whether the count of inversion of two types are same or not when the input array is `[1,2,0]` and the number of types is 3. The function returns `False` because the count of inversion of type 0 and type 1 are not same.\r\n\r\nThe third test case checks whether the count of inversion of two types are same or not when the input array is `[1,2,1]` and the number of types is 3. The function returns `True` because the count of inversion of type 0 and type 1 are both 1. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
