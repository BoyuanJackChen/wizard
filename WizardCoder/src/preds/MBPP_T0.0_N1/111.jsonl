It uses a while loop to iterate through all the numbers until it finds the n'th smart number. The variable `count` keeps track of how many smart numbers have been found so far, and the variable `num` keeps track of the current number being checked. If the current number is divisible by 10, it is a smart number, so `count` is incremented. Once `count` reaches `n`, the function returns the current value of `num`, which is the n'th smart number.\r\n\r\nWe can test the function using the test examples provided:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert smartNumber(1) == 30\r\nassert smartNumber(50) == 273\r\nassert smartNumber(1000) == 2664\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test should pass, since the first smart number is 30.
