{"task_id": 417, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef group_tuples(lst):\r\n    result = []\r\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\r\n        if i == 0:\r\n            result.append([lst[i][0]])\r\n        else:\r\n            if lst[i][0] in result[-1]:\r\n                result[-1].append(lst[i][1])\r\n            else:\r\n                result.append([lst[i][0], lst[i][1]])\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function `group_tuples` takes a list of tuples as input and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the common first element of the tuples in the input list. If there are no common first elements, then the function returns a list with a single tuple containing all the first elements of the input tuples.\r\n\r\nThe function uses a loop to iterate over the input list. For the first tuple, it creates a new tuple with the first element of the first tuple as its only element. For subsequent tuples, it checks if the first element of the current tuple is already in the last tuple of the result list. If it is, it appends the second element of the current tuple to the last tuple of the result list. If it is not, it creates a new tuple with the first element of the current tuple as its first element and the second element of the current tuple as its second element.
