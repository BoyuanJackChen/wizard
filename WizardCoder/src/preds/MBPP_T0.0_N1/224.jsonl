{"task_id": 235, "completion": "Here's the Python function to set all even bits of a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef even_bit_set_number(num):\r\n    # Initialize a variable to store the result\r\n    result = 0\r\n    \r\n    # Loop through each bit of the number\r\n    for i in range(32):\r\n        # Check if the bit is even\r\n        if num & (1 << i) != 0:\r\n            # If the bit is even, set the corresponding bit in the result\r\n            result |= (1 << i)\r\n    \r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. We initialize a variable `result` to 0, which will store the final result.\r\n2. We loop through each bit of the number using a `for` loop and the `range()` function. We use `range(32)` because we're working with 32-bit numbers.\r\n3. For each bit, we use the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to check if the bit is set. We use `(1 << i)` to create a bitmask that has a 1 in the i-th position and 0s elsewhere. We then use this bitmask to check if the i-th bit of `num` is set.\r\n4. If the i-th bit of `num` is set, we set the corresponding bit in `result` using the bitwise OR operator (`|`). We use `(1 << i)` again to create a bitmask with a 1 in the i-th position and 0s elsewhere, and then use this bitmask to set the i-th bit of `result`.\r\n5. After looping through all bits, we return the final value of `result`.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\r\nassert even_bit_set_number(20) == 30\r\nassert even_bit_set_number(30) == 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case checks that the function returns the input number if all bits are already set to even. The second test case checks that the function correctly sets the even bits of the input number to 1. The third test case checks that the function returns the input number if all bits are already set to even. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
