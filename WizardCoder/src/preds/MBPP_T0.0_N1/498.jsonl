If it is, we return an error message. Otherwise, we initialize variables to keep track of the sum of odd numbers and the count of odd numbers. We then loop through odd numbers from 1 to the given number (inclusive) with a step of 2, and add each odd number to the sum and increment the count. Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count and return the result. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
