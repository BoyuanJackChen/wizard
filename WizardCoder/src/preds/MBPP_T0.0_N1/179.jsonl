{"task_id": 190, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the number of integral co-ordinates that lie inside a square:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Intgral_Points(x1, y1, x2, y2):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for x in range(x1, x2+1):\r\n        for y in range(y1, y2+1):\r\n            if x == int(x) and y == int(y):\r\n                count += 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes in four arguments: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, which represent the coordinates of the corners of the square. It initializes a counter variable `count` to 0 and then loops through all the possible integral co-ordinates within the square. For each co-ordinate, it checks if both the x and y values are integral using the `int()` function. If they are, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert count_Intgral_Points(1,1,4,4) == 4\r\nassert count_Intgral_Points(1,2,1,2) == 1\r\nassert count_Intgral_Points(4,2,6,4) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test example checks if the function correctly counts the number of integral co-ordinates within a square that has its corners at (1,1) and (4,4). The function should return 4, which is the correct answer.\r\n\r\nThe second test example checks if the function correctly counts the number of integral co-ordinates within a square that has its corners at (1,2) and (1,2). The function should return 1, which is the correct answer.\r\n\r\nThe third test example checks if the function correctly counts the number of integral co-ordinates within a square that has its corners at (4,2) and (6,4). The function should return 1, which is the correct answer. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
