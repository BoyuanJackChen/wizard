The function first creates a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer in the input lists. It then creates a heap `heap` of tuples, where each tuple contains the negative frequency of an integer and the integer itself. The negative frequency is used to make the heap a max heap, so that the largest frequency integers are popped first. The `heapq` module is used to create the heap and to pop the top `k` integers from the heap.\r\n\r\nThe test cases provided in the problem statement are tested using the `assert` statement.
