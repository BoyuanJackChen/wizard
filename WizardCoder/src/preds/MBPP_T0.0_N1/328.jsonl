{"task_id": 339, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the maximum occuring divisor in an interval:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_Divisor(start, end):\r\n    max_divisor = 0\r\n    for i in range(start, end+1):\r\n        for j in range(2, i):\r\n            if i % j == 0:\r\n                max_divisor = max(max_divisor, j)\r\n    return max_divisor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments, `start` and `end`, which represent the interval. It initializes a variable `max_divisor` to 0, which will store the maximum divisor found in the interval. It then loops through all the numbers in the interval, and for each number, it loops through all the numbers from 2 to that number (exclusive). If the number is divisible by any of those numbers, it updates the `max_divisor` variable with the maximum of the current `max_divisor` and the divisor. Finally, it returns the `max_divisor` variable.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert find_Divisor(2,2) == 2\r\nassert find_Divisor(2,5) == 2\r\nassert find_Divisor(5,10) == 2\r\nassert find_Divisor(1,10) == 1\r\nassert find_Divisor(10,100) == 1\r\nassert find_Divisor(100,1000) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the first two test cases, the maximum divisor is 2, which is the only divisor in the interval. In the third test case, the maximum divisor is also 2, since all the numbers in the interval are divisible by 2. In the fourth test case, the maximum divisor is 1, since there is only one number in the interval. In the fifth and sixth test cases, the maximum divisor is also 1, since all the numbers in the interval are prime. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
