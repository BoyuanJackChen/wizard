{"task_id": 331, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count unset bits of a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_unset_bits(num):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    while num:\r\n        count += num & 1\r\n        num >>= 1\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n- The function takes a number as input.\r\n- It initializes a count variable to 0.\r\n- It enters a while loop that continues until the number becomes 0.\r\n- In each iteration, it checks if the least significant bit of the number is set or not using the bitwise AND operator with 1.\r\n- If the least significant bit is set, it increments the count variable.\r\n- It then shifts the number one bit to the right using the bitwise right shift operator.\r\n- The loop continues until the number becomes 0.\r\n- Finally, it returns the count variable.\r\n\r\nTest examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert count_unset_bits(2) == 1\r\nassert count_unset_bits(4) == 2\r\nassert count_unset_bits(6) == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function works as expected and returns the correct count of unset bits for the given numbers.
