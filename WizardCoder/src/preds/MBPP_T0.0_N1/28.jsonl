First, we create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the character and its index in the string. We do this using a list comprehension that iterates over the characters in the string and their indices, and creates a tuple for each one.\r\n2. We then sort the list by character, then by index. This ensures that we can iterate over the characters in the string in a valid order.\r\n3. We create a new string by iterating over the sorted list and adding characters to it. We only add a character if it's different from the previous character in the new string. This ensures that we don't end up with two adjacent characters that are the same.\r\n4. Finally, we check if the new string is valid. We do this by iterating over the characters in the new string and checking if any two adjacent characters are the same. If we find any such pair, we return None to indicate that the new string is not valid.\r\n\r\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we need to sort the list of tuples, which takes O(n log n) time. The rest of the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), since we iterate over the characters in the string once.
