{"task_id": 471, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the remainder of array multiplication divided by n:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_remainder(arr, n, m):\r\n    product = 1\r\n    for i in arr:\r\n        product *= i\r\n    return product % n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes three arguments: `arr` is the array of integers, `n` is the modulus, and `m` is the number of times the array is multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe function first initializes a variable `product` to 1. It then iterates through the array, multiplying each element by `product`. Finally, it returns the remainder of the product divided by `n`.\r\n\r\nThe test cases provided in the problem statement can be tested using the `assert` statement. Here's how you can test the function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert find_remainder([ 100, 10, 5, 25, 35, 14 ],6,11) == 9\r\nassert find_remainder([1,1,1],3,1) == 0\r\nassert find_remainder([1,2,1],3,2) == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the function returns the expected output for all the test cases, then it is working correctly.
