{"task_id": 123, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef amicable_numbers_sum(n):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Returns the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to n.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    total = 0\r\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\r\n        # Calculate the divisors of i\r\n        divisors = [j for j in range(1, i+1) if i % j == 0]\r\n        # Calculate the divisors of the sum of divisors of i\r\n        divisors_sum = sum(divisors)\r\n        if divisors_sum != i and i == sum(divisors) and i != divisors_sum:\r\n            total += i\r\n    return total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function `amicable_numbers_sum` takes a number `n` as input and returns the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to `n`. An amicable number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. For example, 220 is an amicable number because 220 = (1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55) and 284 is also an amicable number because 284 = (1 + 2 + 4 + 71).\r\n\r\nThe function first initializes a variable `total` to 0. It then loops through all numbers from 1 to `n`. For each number `i`, it calculates the divisors of `i` using a list comprehension. It then calculates the sum of the divisors of `i` and checks if it is equal to `i` and if `i` is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. If both conditions are true, then `i` is an amicable number and its value is added to the `total` variable. Finally, the function returns the `total` variable.\r\n\r\nThe test examples provided in the problem statement can be tested using the `assert` statement. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert amicable_numbers_sum(999) == 504\r\nassert amicable_numbers_sum(9999) == 31626\r\nassert amicable_numbers_sum(99) == 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test example checks if the function returns the correct sum of amicable numbers from 1 to 999. The second test example checks if the function returns the correct sum of amicable numbers from 1 to 9999. The third test example checks if the function returns 0 for a number less than 1000.
