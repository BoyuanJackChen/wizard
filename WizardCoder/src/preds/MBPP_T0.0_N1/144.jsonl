{"task_id": 155, "completion": "Here's the Python function to toggle all even bits of a given number:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef even_bit_toggle_number(num):\r\n    # Initialize a variable to store the result\r\n    result = 0\r\n    \r\n    # Loop through each bit of the number\r\n    for i in range(32):\r\n        # Check if the bit is even\r\n        if num & (1 << i):\r\n            # If the bit is even, toggle it by subtracting it from the result\r\n            result -= (1 << i)\r\n        else:\r\n            # If the bit is odd, add it to the result\r\n            result += (1 << i)\r\n    \r\n    # Return the result\r\n    return result\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's how the function works:\r\n\r\n1. We initialize a variable called `result` to 0, which will store the final result.\r\n2. We loop through each bit of the number using a `for` loop and the `range()` function. We use `range(32)` because we're working with 32-bit numbers.\r\n3. For each bit, we check if it's even or odd using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) and a bit mask that has a 1 in the position of the bit we want to check. For example, to check if the first bit is even, we use `(1 << 0)` as the bit mask.\r\n4. If the bit is even, we toggle it by subtracting it from the result. We do this by subtracting `(1 << i)` from the result, where `i` is the position of the bit we want to toggle.\r\n5. If the bit is odd, we add it to the result. We do this by adding `(1 << i)` to the result, where `i` is the position of the bit we want to toggle.\r\n6. After looping through all the bits, we return the final result.\r\n\r\nHere are some test cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert even_bit_toggle_number(10) == 0\r\nassert even_bit_toggle_number(20) == 30\r\nassert even_bit_toggle_number(30) == 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first test case checks if the function correctly toggles the even bits of 10, which should result in 0. The second test case checks if the function correctly toggles the even bits of 20, which should result in 30. The third test case checks if the function correctly toggles the even bits of 30, which should result in 20. ", "all_code": "Below is an instruction that describes a task.
