{"task_id": 114, "completion": "Here's the Python script for the given problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef assign_freq(tuples_list):\r\n    freq_dict = {}\r\n    for tup in tuples_list:\r\n        if tup not in freq_dict:\r\n            freq_dict[tup] = 1\r\n        else:\r\n            freq_dict[tup] += 1\r\n    result = []\r\n    for tup, freq in freq_dict.items():\r\n        result.append((*tup, freq))\r\n    return str(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function `assign_freq` takes a list of tuples as input and returns a string representation of the list of tuples with the frequency of each tuple added as the last element of the tuple. The function first creates an empty dictionary `freq_dict` to store the frequency of each tuple. It then iterates through the list of tuples and updates the frequency count in the dictionary. Finally, it creates a new list `result` and appends tuples with the frequency count as the last element. The function returns the string representation of the `result` list.\r\n\r\nThe test cases provided in the problem statement can be tested using the `assert` statement.
