{"task_id": 311, "completion": "Here's the Python function to set the left most unset bit:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(num):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Returns the number with the left most unset bit set.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return num | (num - 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe left most unset bit in a binary number is the least significant bit that is not set. To set the left most unset bit, we can subtract 1 from the number and then perform a bitwise OR operation with the original number. This will set the left most unset bit to 1.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the number 10 in binary:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1010\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe left most unset bit is the least significant bit, which is 0. To set it, we subtract 1 from 10:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1001\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we perform a bitwise OR operation with 10:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1101\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the result we want.
