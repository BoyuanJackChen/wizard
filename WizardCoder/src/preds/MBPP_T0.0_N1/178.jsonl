It then iterates through the input list and checks if each number is positive and not already in the set. If it is, it is added to the set. \r\n\r\nAfter that, the function iterates through the range of positive numbers and checks if each number is in the set. If it is not, it returns that number as the first missing positive number. If all numbers are present, the function returns the length of the input list + 1 as the first missing positive number.
