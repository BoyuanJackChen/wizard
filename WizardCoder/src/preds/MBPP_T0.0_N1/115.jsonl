{"task_id": 126, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the sum of common divisors of two given numbers:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sum_common_divisors(num1, num2):\r\n    divisors = set()\r\n    for i in range(1, min(num1, num2) + 1):\r\n        if num1 % i == 0 and num2 % i == 0:\r\n            divisors.add(i)\r\n    return sum(divisors)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments `num1` and `num2`, and returns the sum of their common divisors. It uses a set to store the common divisors, and iterates through all numbers from 1 to the smaller of the two numbers. If a number is a divisor of both `num1` and `num2`, it is added to the set of divisors.
