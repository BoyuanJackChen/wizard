{"task_id": 446, "completion": "Here's the Python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef count_Occurrence(tup, lst):\r\n    count = 0\r\n    for i in lst:\r\n        count += tup.count(i)\r\n    return count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes two arguments: `tup` is the tuple and `lst` is the list of elements to count the occurrence of. It initializes a `count` variable to 0 and then loops through each element in `lst`. For each element, it adds the number of times it appears in `tup` to `count`. Finally, it returns `count`.\r\n\r\nHere are the test examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3\r\nassert count_Occurrence((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4),[1, 4, 7]) == 6\r\nassert count_Occurrence((1,2,3,4,5,6),[1,2]) == 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the test examples pass.
