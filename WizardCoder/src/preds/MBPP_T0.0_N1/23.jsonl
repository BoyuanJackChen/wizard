{"task_id": 34, "completion": "Here's the Python function to find the missing number in a sorted array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_missing(arr):\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    if n == 0:\r\n        return None\r\n    elif n == 1:\r\n        return 2 if arr[0] == 1 else 1\r\n    else:\r\n        for i in range(1, n):\r\n            if arr[i] - arr[i-1] != 1:\r\n                return arr[i-1] + 1\r\n        return arr[n-1] + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the missing number in the array. If the array is empty, the function returns `None`. If the array has only one element, the function returns 2 if the element is 1, and 1 otherwise. If the array has more than one element, the function iterates through the array and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is 1. If the difference is not 1, the function returns the missing number, which is the next number in the sequence after the last element of the array. If the function iterates through the entire array and does not find a missing number, the function returns the next number in the sequence after the last element of the array.
