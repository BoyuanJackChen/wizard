{"task_id": 72, "completion": "Here's the Python function to check whether the given number can be represented as difference of two squares or not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef dif_Square(n):\r\n    for i in range(1, int(n/2)+1):\r\n        if n == i*i + (i+1)*(i+1):\r\n            return True\r\n    return False\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nThe function takes a number `n` as input and checks if it can be represented as the difference of two squares. It does this by iterating over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `n/2` and checking if `n` can be represented as `i*i + (i+1)*(i+1)`. If it can, then it returns `True`. If it cannot, then it returns `False`.\r\n\r\nTest examples:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert dif_Square(5) == True\r\nassert dif_Square(10) == False\r\nassert dif_Square(15) == True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function works by checking all possible values of `i` from 1 to `n/2`. For example, for `n=5`, the function checks if `5` can be represented as `i*i + (i+1)*(i+1)` for any `i` from 1 to 2. Since `i=1` satisfies this condition, the function returns `True`.
